<h1>Get the Turbine's Real Power and Increase Engine Torque!</h1>
<p>
All HKS Intercoolers improve both the efficiency and power of any turbocharged application by rapidly reducing inherent heat levels of the compressed intake air charge before entering the engine. By utilizing a special tube and fin design, the intercooler acts as a large heat exchanger that dissipates the heat generated by the compression of the intake charge without creating reductions in boost pressure or response.

<quote cite"">
Our design philosophy has four important parts: optimising the intake system, optimising the exhaust system, specifying the best possible performing intercooler, and finally, most importantly joining the whole package together with state of the art engine management that is never miss-matched for the application.

<h2>Choosing the correct Crankshaft</h2>
<quote cite="http://www.enginebuildermag.com/2016/02/theres-no-simple-formula-to-choosing-the-perfect-camshaft/?eid=284935490&bid=1322731">
<p>
Proper camshaft selection allows the maximum amount of air/fuel mixture into an engine for a given application. The amount of fuel that can be used, then removed efficiently, (volumetric efficiency VE), will not only dictate engine power but also the entire engine package selected for the build. After all, the camshaft design affects valve timing, compression and the engine’s ability to breathe. From pistons to manifolds, valve grind, piston pin offset, rod length, etc. Once the camshaft has been tabbed correctly for the application, the rest of the build can focus off that selection.

	What won’t be provided here is a “sure-fire can’t miss” camshaft selection formula. It simply doesn’t exist. The list of variables is far too great. Proper camshaft selection is a combination of first and foremost, your experience coupled with the determined usage; engine displacement, compression ratio, fuel system carbureted or injected, RPM range power desired, transmission type/converter stall speed, vehicle weight, final gear ratio, tire height, cylinder head and valves, head flow, manifolds, rocker arm ratios, aspiration and emissions test passage if necessary.
